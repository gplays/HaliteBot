Following Schut chapter 6 framework:

Objectives:

 - We aim to build and train a chatbot to be able to be on par (>50% victory) with existing bots on the Halite 2 game
 - We will 'confirm' the usability of GF for this task. We will 'optimise' its performance through the 'discovery' of a
   Delegate MAS framework
 - We will deliver the bot

TODO rewrite these as 2-3 objectives that have 0/1 answer

Questions:

How can GF allow multi-scale coordination in a certain, adversarial environment?
How delegate MAS and ants processes can organise and process environment information to allow complex emerging GF
coordination?


Hypotheses:

GF encompass obstacle avoidance in navigation (small scale)
GF allows complex strategy to emerge in an adversarial environment.
Ants processes augment time and objective efficiency in a GF framework.

TODO find less obviuous hypothesis? Find less "true" prone hypothesis
